* Make image bigger
* Create pieces proportional to screen
* Ensure that a block snaps to another, regardless of which piece is being dragged
* Make space responsive to changes to viewport (not easy)
* Prevent page from reloading if you drag down on touchscreen
* Provide reload button for that case
